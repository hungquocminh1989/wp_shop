WooCommerce stock management, inventory management, inline edit, instant search, export; bulk edit and update of products, variations, orders, blog posts, any WordPress custom post types…Smart Manager is jam-packed with powerful features both in the Lite and the [Pro version](https://www.storeapps.org/product/smart-manager/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=smwp_readme).

It’s your smart WooCommerce store manager that boost your store productivity 10x and gives you massive time savings.

19350+ happy users, 4.3 stars out of 5 from 130+ reviews, 8+ years track record.
You won’t go wrong with Smart Manager.

While the Lite (free) plugin is very useful, we’ve included even more advanced features in [Smart Manager Pro](https://www.storeapps.org/product/smart-manager/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=smwp_readme)...
> **[Click here](https://www.storeapps.org/docs/sm-lite-vs-pro/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=smwp_readme) to know the difference between Lite & Pro.**

Here’s what Smart Manager Lite **(Free version)** offers:

&#128312;&nbsp;**Single screen interface** to browse and manage the following post types - products, variations, orders, blog posts and coupons.
&#128312;&nbsp;**See all records on one screen. Infinite scrolling** for smoother navigation.
&#128312;&nbsp;**Inline edit (direct edit) post types and records from the grid**: Edit all the WooCommerce and WordPress fields which are available in your store. Lite version provides up to 3 inline edits at one go for all supported post types without saving the changes.

=>&nbsp;**Products and Variations** - update stock status and inventory levels, manage backorders, SKU, change product description, product category, attributes, tax; increase or decrease sale price and regular price, etc. WooCommerce stock management was never so easier.
=>&nbsp;**Orders** - change order status, billing details, shipping fields, subscription status, currency, etc.
=>&nbsp;**Coupons** - modify coupon usage, amount, type, expiry date, etc.
=>&nbsp;**Posts** - update post status, seo status, title, image, etc.
&#128312;&nbsp;Edit all supported post types using **search filters, date filters and column filters**.
&#128312;&nbsp;**Add / delete** single or multiple products, product variations, orders, coupons, blog posts. 
&#128312;&nbsp;**Search** using keywords, categories, attributes or any other field. Smart Manager will display the desired results quickly.
&#128312;&nbsp;Get more specific results using **Advanced Search with AND condition**. Say SKU - WC01 and price above $100; you will only get records matching these conditions.

&#128312;&nbsp;**Personalize dashboard** view by setting the columns that you want to view & manage for each of the dashboards. Smart Manager will automatically save and persist in the same view.
&#128312;&nbsp;**Sort the grid** based on a particular data column like sale price in ascending or decreasing order. Also, manage the state of the column sorted in the dashboard.
&#128312;&nbsp;Sticky header to stay always in control even when scrolling through thousands of WooCommerce Products or other post types.

Read what Jeff has to say on Smart Manager Pro...

> **I would happily pay five times for this product!**
> What really sold me on this (Smart Manager Pro) was Batch Update. My assistant does not have to do any complex math now (earlier, I always feared she would make a mistake)! With Smart Manager, she has more free time at hand, hence I asked her to set up autoresponder emails for our customers. The response was phenomenal. Our repeat sales were up by 19.5%. I would happily pay five times for this product!
> - Jeff Smith

And here’s Kevin's review...

> **A massive time saver...flawless export!**
> We have over 6000 individual lines on our site and this has saved us huge amounts of time.
Batch update works flawlessly which is a massive time saver, if you need to change all of your prices on the entire site by a % or value, you can with a couple of clicks! We made an update to Tax class on all products in less than 3 minutes. The CSV export tool actually works unlike some I have tried, all 6000 odd lines neatly exported in one attempt. No missing or corrupt data.
> - Kevin Goodchild, [Obsolete Electronic Components](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/99-is-nothing-compared-to-the-time-we-have-saved/)

Smart Manager will free up so much time from day to day store administration operations that you will be in awe. Whether it is reviewing orders at a glance, or updating pricing and inventory of multiple products at once. Whether it is quickly finding a customer or looking up a coupon – everything is super quick and super easy.

> Work "**on**" your business. Not "**in**" it. Once you save hours from daily chores, you can invest that time for scaling up and growing your business – much better use of your own time!
